<h4>Muslims should not semi-hibernate during Ramadan</h4>
<h5>Shaikh Abullah Hakim Quick </h5>
<p>All praises to Allah, Lord of the worlds. He who revealed in His Glorious Qur'an, 
  &quot;Oh you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed 
  for those who came before you that you may keep your duty to your Lord (having 
  taqwa),&quot; 2:185. And may blessings and peace of Allah be upon His last Messenger 
  Muhammad ibn Abdullah, forever.</p>
<p>Oh you who believe, Ramadan is a sacred month wherein Almighty Allah is constantly 
  testing His creation and giving humanity the opportunity to achieve infinite, 
  endless Bliss. Fasting is a complete purification and a means to developing 
  the consciousness of Allah's presence. The consciousness of Allah (Taqua) is 
  a protection against the schemes of Shaitan, and the suffering of this world. 
  Allah has informed us that, &quot;Whoever keeps his duty to Allah (has taqua), 
  He ordains a way out for him and gives him sustenance from where he imagines 
  not. And whoever trusts in Allah, He is sufficient for him. Surely Allah attains 
  His purpose. Allah has appointed a measure for everything.&quot; (65:2)</p>
<p>Many Muslims today have a misconception about fasting and the activities of 
  a fasting person. They go into a state of semi-hibernation, spending most of 
  their daylight hours in bed. If they fear Allah, they wake up for prayer, but 
  then return to sleep immediately. This unnatural sleep makes them become lazy, 
  dull-witted and often cranky.</p>
<p>Ramadan is actually a time of increased activity wherein the believer, now 
  lightened of the burdens of constant eating and drinking, should be more willing 
  to strive and struggle for Allah. The Prophet (pbuh) passes through approximately 
  nine Ramadans after the Hijrah. They were filled with decisive events and left 
  us a shining example of sacrifice and submission to Allah.</p>
<p>In the first year after the Hijrah, the Prophet (pbuh) sent Hamza ibn Abdul 
  Mattalib with thirty Muslim riders to Saif al Bahr to investigate three hundred 
  riders from Quraish who had camped suspiciously in that area. The Muslims were 
  about to engage the disbelievers, but they were separated by Majdy ibn Umar 
  al-Juhany. The Hypocrites of Al-Madinah, hoping to oppose the unity of the Muslims, 
  built their own masjid (called Masjid al-Dirar). The Prophet (pbuh) ordered 
  this masjid to be destroyed in Ramadan.</p>
<p>On the seventeenth of Ramadan, 3 A.H., Almighty Allah separated truth from 
  falsehood at the Great Battle of Badr. The Prophet (pbuh) and 313 of his companions 
  set out to intercept a caravan of their own goods that had been left in Makkah. 
  It was led by Abu Sufyan, himself, and estimated at 50,000 dinars. They were 
  met, instead, by a well-equipped army of the nobility of Quraish, intent on 
  putting out the light of Islam. Despite being outnumbered three to one and appearing 
  weak and unseasoned, the Muslims defended their faith with a burning desire 
  to protect the meet their Lord through martyrdom. Allah gave them a decisive 
  victory on this day of Ramadan, that would never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>In 6 A.H., Zaid ibn Haritha was sent to Wadi al-Qura at the head of a detachment 
  to confront Fatimah bint Rabiah, the queen of that area. Fatimah had previously 
  attacked a caravan led by Zaid and had succeeded in plundering its wealth. She 
  was known to be the most protected woman in Arabia, as she hung fifty swords 
  of her close relatives in her home. Fatimah was equally renowned for showing 
  open hostility to Islam. She was killed in a battle against these Muslims in 
  the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>By Ramadan of 8 A.H., the treaty of Hudaibiyya had been broken and the Muslim 
  armies had engaged the Byzantines in the North, Muhammad (pbuh) felt the need 
  to strike a fatal blow to disbelief in the Arabian Peninsula and conquer the 
  city of Mecca. Allah had declared His Sanctuary a place of peace, security and 
  religious sanctity. Now the time had come to purify the Kaabah of nakedness 
  and abomination. The Prophet (pbuh) set out with an army having more armed men 
  than Al-Madinah had ever seen before. People were swelling the army's ranks 
  as it moved toward Makkah. The determination of the believers, guided by the 
  Will of Allah, became so awesome that the city of Makkah was conquered without 
  a battle, on 20 Ramadan. This was one of the most important dates in Islamic 
  history for after it, Islam was firmly entrenched in the Arabian Peninsula. 
  During the same month and year, after smashing the idols of Makkah, detachments 
  were sent to the other major centers of polytheism and al-Lat, Manat and Suwa, 
  some of the greatest idols of Arabia, were destroyed.</p>
<p>Such was the month of Ramadan in the time of the Prophet (pbuh). It was a time 
  of purification, enjoining the good, forbidding evil, and striving hard with 
  one's life and wealth. After the death of the Prophet (pbuh), Muslims carried 
  on this tradition and Allah used the true believers to affect the course of 
  history. Ramadan continued to be a time of great trials and crucial events.</p>
<p>Ninety-two years after the Hujrah, Islam had spread across North Africa, Iran, 
  Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria. Spain was under the tyrannical rule of King Roderic 
  of the Visigoths. Roderic had forced his six million serfs and persecuted Jews 
  to seek the aid of the Muslims of North Africa in order to be delivered. Musa 
  ibn Husair, the Umayyad governor of North Africa, responded by sending his courageous 
  general Tariq ibn Ziyad at the head of 12,000 Berber and Arab troops. In Ramadan 
  of that year, they were confronted with a combined Visigoth army of 90,000 Christians 
  led by Roderic, himself, who was seated on a throne of ivory, silver, and precious 
  gems and drawn by white mules. After burning his boats, Tariq preached to the 
  Muslims warning them that victory and Paradise lay ahead of them and<br>
  defeat and the sea lay to the rear. They burst forth with great enthusiasm and 
  Allah manifested a clear victory over the forces of disbelief. Not only was 
  Roderic killed and his forces completely annihilated, but Tariq and Musa succeeded 
  in liberating the whole of Spain, Sicily and parts of France. This was the beginning 
  of the Golden Age of Al-Andalus where Muslims ruled for over 7000 years. In 
  the year 582 A.H., Salahuddin al-Ayyubi, after battling with the Crusaders for 
  years, finally drove them out of Syria and the whole of their occupied lands 
  in the month of Ramadan. The Muslim world was then destined to meet one of its 
  most frightening challenges.</p>
<p>In the seventh century A.H. the Mongols were sweeping across Asia destroying 
  everything that lay in their path. Genghis Khan called himself &quot;the scourge 
  of God sent to punish humanity for their sins. &quot;In 617 A.H. Samarkand, 
  Ray, and Hamdan were put to the sword causing more than 700,000 people to be 
  killed or made captive. In 656 A.H. Hulagu, the grandson of Genghis Khan, continued 
  this destruction. Even Baghdad, the leading city of the Muslim world, was sacked. 
  Some estimates say that as many as 1,800,000 Muslims were killed in this awesome 
  carnage. The Christians were asked to eat pork and drink wine openly while the 
  surviving Muslims were forced to participate in drinking bouts. Wine was sprinkled 
  in the masjids and no Azan (call to prayer) was allowed. In the wake of such 
  a<br>
  horrible disaster and with the threat of the whole Muslim world and then Europe 
  being subjected to the same fate, Allah raised up from the Mamluks of Egypt, 
  Saifuddin Qutz, who, united the Muslim army and met the Mongols at Ain Jalut 
  on 25th Ramadan, 458 A.H. Although they were under great pressure, the Muslims 
  with the help of Allah, cunning strategy and unflinching bravery, crushed the 
  Mongol army and reversed this tidal wave of horror. The whole of the civilized 
  world sighed in relief and stood in awe at the remarkable achievement of these 
  noble sons of Islam. </p>
<p>This was the spirit of Ramadan that enabled our righteous forefathers to face 
  seemingly impossible challenges. It was a time of intense activity, spending 
  the day in the saddle and the night in prayer while calling upon Allah for His 
  mercy and forgiveness.</p>
<p>Today, the Muslim world is faced with drought, military aggression, wide-spread 
  corruption and tempting materialism. Surely we are in need of believers who 
  can walk in the footsteps of our beloved Prophet (pbuh), the illustrious Sahabah, 
  Tariq ibn Ziyad, Qutuz, Salahuddin and the countless heroes of Islam. Surely 
  we are in need of believers who are unafraid of the threats of the disbelievers, 
  yet kind and humble to the believing people; Muslims whose fast is compete and 
  not just a source of hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>May Allah raise up a generation of Muslims who can carry Islam to all corners 
  of the globe in a manner that befits our age, and may He give us the strength 
  and the success to lay the proper foundations for them. May Allah make us<br>
  of those who carry out our Islam during Ramadan and after it, and may He not 
  make us of those who say what they do not do. Surely Allah and His Angels invoke 
  blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad. Oh you who believe send blessings 
  and peace to him forever. </p>
<p></p>
