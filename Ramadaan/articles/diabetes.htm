<h4>DIABETES MELLITUS AND RAMADAN FASTING</h4>
<p>Diabetes mellitus affects people of all faiths. Muslims are no exception. Many 
  diabetic Muslims have a desire to fast during the month of Ramadan, although 
  if they cannot for health reasons, they have a valid exemption. The dilemma 
  for physicians and Muslim scholars is whether or not Muslim diabetic patients 
  (1) should be allowed to fast if they decide to; (2) can fast safely; (3) can 
  be helped to fast if they decide to; (4 ) can have their disease monitored at 
  home; and (5) are going to derive any benefit or harm to their health. Fasting 
  during Ramadan by a Muslim diabetic patient is neither his right nor Islamic 
  obligation, but only a privilege to be allowed by his physician, at the patient's 
  request, knowing all the dangers and assuming full responsibility in dietary 
  compliance and glucose monitoring, with good communication between the physician 
  and the patient .</p>
<p><br>
  PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE OF DIABETES DURING RAMADAN</p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus itself adversely affects patients' psychological states by 
  changes in glucose metabolism, blood and CSF osmolality, needs for discipline 
  and compliance, fear of long term complications and threat of hypoglycemic attacks 
  and the possibility of dehydration and coma.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fasting during Ramadan has a tranquilizing effect on the 
  mind, producing inner peace and decrease in anger and hostility. Fasting Muslims 
  realize that manifestations of anger may take away the blessings of fasting 
  or even nullify them.</p>
<p>Diabetics know that stress increases the blood glucose by increasing the catecholamine 
  level and any tool to lower the stress ; ie., biofeedback or relaxation improves 
  diabetic control. Thus, Islamic fasting during Ramadan should have a potentially 
  beneficial effect with regard to dia- betic control.</p>
<p><br>
  EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOR DIABETICS DURING RAMADAN</p>
<p>It should be directed toward (a) diabetic home management; (b) preparing them 
  for Ramadan; (c) recognizing warning symptoms of dehydration, hypoglycemia and 
  other possible complications.</p>
<p>Patients should be taught home glucose monitoring, checking urine for acetone, 
  doing daily weights, calorie-controlled diabetic diet, need for sleep and normal 
  exercise. They should be able to take pulse, temperature, look for skin infection 
  and notice changes in the sensorium ( mental alertness ) . They should be on 
  special alert for any colicky pain, a sign for renal colic, or hyperventilation, 
  a sign of dehydration, and to be able to seek medical help quickly rather than 
  wait for the next day.</p>
<p><br>
  CRITERIA ALLOWING DIABETICS TO FAST DURING RAMADAN</p>
<p>a. All male diabetics over age 20. <br>
  b. All female diabetics over age 20 if not pregnant or nursing. <br>
  c. Body weight normal or above ideal body weight. <br>
  d . Absence of infection, co-existing unstable medical conditions, ie, <br>
  coronary artery disease, severe hypertension (B/P 200/120), kidney stones, COPD 
  or emphysema. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
