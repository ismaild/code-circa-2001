<h4>Zakah</h4>
<h5>What is Zakah?</h5>
<p> <a href="http://www.sanzaf.org.za/html/index.htm" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/sanzaf_logo.gif" width="99" height="95" border="0" align="right"></a>Zakah 
  is an obligatory form of &quot;charity&quot; expected from every Muslim individual. 
  This form of &quot;charity&quot; is an act of worship and a form of social investment. 
  Zakah is one the five pillars or fundamentals of Islam. The remaining pillars 
  are the Shahadah (profession of faith), performing daily Salat (prayers), fasting 
  and pilgrimage to Makkah. Zakah is considered an important economic tool in 
  an Islamic State or society. It provides a religiously approved method of managing 
  the economy and finance. Zakah has also been scrupulously prescribed in the 
  Holy Qur'an (where it is mentioned in 30 verses of the Holy Qur'an) and Al Hadeeth. 
</p>
<h5>Definition of Zakah</h5>
<p> Literally, zakah means to &quot;purify&quot;. It refers to the purification 
  of a Muslim's wealth and soul. Wealth purification denotes the mobilization 
  of assets for the purpose of financial growth and justified distribution. Purification 
  of the soul implies freedom from hatred, jealousy, selfishness, uneasiness and 
  greed. Other Qur'anic connotations include the purification of sin. </p>
<p>Technically, zakah is a fixed proportion collected from the surplus wealth 
  and earnings of a Muslim. It is then distributed to prescribed beneficiaries 
  and for the welfare as well as the infrastructure of a Muslim society in general. 
  This contribution is made payable by a Muslim once in every lunar year (Islamic 
  Calendar/Hijri). </p>
<p>Zakah is paid on the net balance after a Muslim has spent on basic necessities, 
  family expenses, due credits, donations and taxes. Every Muslim male or female 
  who at the end of the Hijri year is in possession of the equivalent of 85 grams 
  of gold or more in cash or articles of trade, must pay his or her zakah at the 
  minimum rate of 2.5%. <br>
