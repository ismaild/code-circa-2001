<h4>Sadaqatul Fitr</h4>
<h5>for 1423/2002</h5>
<h4><font size="3">R10.00 or more per person (minor or adult)</font></h4>
<h5>Sadaqatul Fitr becomes obligatory on a Muslim male and female:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Who is alive at the dawn of Eid-ul-Fitr.</li>
  <li>On whom Zakaat is Waajib or who possesses goods free of debt in excess of 
    his personal needs (eg. house, clothing, furniture, etc.) to the value upon 
    which Zakaat is obligatory.</li>
  <li>On the father, on behalf of his minor children.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Points to Remember</h5>
<ul>
  <li>It is essential that Sadaqatul Fitr be distributed to the poor and needy 
    Muslim before reaching the Eid Gah (or Masjid) on this day. However, if this 
    obligation has not been discharged timeously it should be done subsequently.</li>
  <li>It is preferable to give one's Sadaqatul Fitr first to the needy of one's 
    own family, thereafter to one's needy neighbours and then to any other needy 
    Muslim.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said; &quot;The fast remains suspended 
  between the Heaven's and the Earth until the Fitr is paid.&quot; <em>(Targhib)</em></h5>
