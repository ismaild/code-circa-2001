
<p>Yahya related to me from Malik from Abd Rabbih ibn Said from Abu Bakr ibn Abd 
  ar-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham from A'isha and Umm Salama, the wives of 
  the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, that the Prophet, may 
  Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to get up in the morning junub from 
  intercourse, not a dream, in Ramadan, and then he would fast.&quot; (Malik Book 
  <em>18, Number 18.4.10)</em></p>
