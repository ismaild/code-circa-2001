The Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) addressed his 
companions on the last day of Sha`ban, saying, &quot;Oh people! A great month 
has come over you; a blessed month; a month in which is a night better than a 
thousand months; month in which Allah has made it compulsory upon you to fast 
by day, and voluntary to pray by night. Whoever draws nearer (to Allah) by performing 
any of the (optional) good deeds in (this month) shall receive the same reward 
as performing an obligatory deed at any other time, and whoever discharges an 
obligatory deed in (this month) shall receive the reward of performing seventy 
obligations at any other time. It is the month of patience, and the reward of 
patience is Heaven. It is the month of charity, and a month in which a believer's 
sustenance is increased. Whoever gives food to a fasting person to break his fast, 
shall have his sins forgiven, and he will be saved from the Fire of Hell, and 
he shall have the same reward as the fasting person, without his reward being 
diminished at all.&quot; [Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah]
<p><br>
  In another hadith, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah bless him and grant him 
  peace) says, &quot;Ramadan has come to you. (It is) a month of blessing, in 
  which Allah covers you with blessing, for He sends down Mercy, decreases sins 
  and answers prayers. In it, Allah looks at your competition (in good deeds), 
  and boasts about you to His angels. So show Allah goodness from yourselves, 
  for the unfortunate one is he who is deprived in (this month) of the mercy of 
  Allah, the Mighty, the Exalted.&quot; [Narrated by Tabarani]</p>
<p>On the authority of Talhah ibn `Ubaydullah (may Allah be pleased with him): 
  when the Prophet (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) saw the crescent, 
  he used to say, &quot;Oh Allah! Cause it to appear over us with prosperity, 
  faith (Iman), security and Islam. (Then to the moon:) My Lord and your Lord 
  is Allah.&quot; [Narrated by Tirmidhi, who said it is a good (hasan) hadith.] 
  Qatadah said that he was informed that the Prophet (may Allah bless him and 
  grant him peace) used to say, when seeing the crescent, &quot;A crescent of 
  goodness and orientation, a crescent of goodness and orientation, a crescent 
  of goodness and orientation. (To the moon:) I believe in Allah who created you.&quot; 
  (Three times), and then he would say, &quot;Praise be to Allah who has taken 
  away such- and- such month and brought such-and-such month.&quot; [Narrated 
  by Abu Dawud]</p>
<p><br>
  Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &quot;None of you should fast a day 
  or two before the month of Ramadan unless he has the habit of fasting (Nawafil) 
  (and if his fasting coincides with that day) then he can fast that day.&quot;(Bukhari 
  Volume 3, Book 31, Number 138) <br>
</p>
<p>Narrated Abdullah bin Umar: Allah's Apostle mentioned Ramadan and said, &quot;Do 
  not fast unless you see the crescent (of Ramadan), and do not give up fasting 
  till you see the crescent (of Shawwal), but if the sky is overcast (if you cannot 
  see it), then act on estimation (i.e. count Sha'ban as 30 days).&quot; (Bukhari 
  <em>Volume 3, Book 31, Number 130)</em><br>
