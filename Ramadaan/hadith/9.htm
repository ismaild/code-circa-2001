
<p>Narrated Anas: Zaid bin Thabit said, &quot;We took the Suhur with the Prophet 
  . Then he stood for the prayer.&quot; I asked, &quot;What was the interval between 
  the Suhur and the Adhan?&quot; He replied, &quot;The interval was sufficient 
  to recite fifty verses of the Quran.&quot; (Bukhari <em>Volume 3, Book 31, Number 
  144)</em></p>
