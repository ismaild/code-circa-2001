
<p>Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet used to kiss and embrace (his wives) while he 
  was fasting, and he had more power to control his desires than any of you. Said 
  Jabir, &quot;The person who gets discharge after casting a look (on his wife) 
  should complete his fast.&quot; (Bukhari <em>Volume 3, Book 31, Number 149)</em><br>
</p>
<p>Narrated Hisham's father: Aisha said, &quot;Allah's Apostle used to kiss some 
  of his wives while he was fasting,&quot; and then she smiled. (Bukhari <em>Volume 
  3, Book 31, Number 150)</em><br>
</p>
<p>Yahya related to me from Malik from Zayd ibn Aslam from Ata ibn Yasar that 
  Abdullah ibn Abbas was asked about people kissing while fasting and he said 
  that he allowed it for old men but disapproved of it for young men. (Malik Book 
  <em>18, Number 18.6.19)</em><br>
