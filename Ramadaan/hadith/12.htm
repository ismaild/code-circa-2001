
<p>Narrated 'Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) Hamza bin 'Amr Al-Aslami asked the 
  Prophet, &quot;Should I fast while traveling?&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;You 
  may fast if you wish, and you may not fast if you wish.&quot; (Bukhari <em>Volume 
  3, Book 31, Number 164)</em></p>
<p>Narrated Abu Ad-Darda: We set out with Allah's Apostle on one of his journeys 
  on a very hot day, and it was so hot that one had to put his hand over his head 
  because of the severity of heat. None of us was fasting except the Prophet and 
  Ibn Rawaha. (Bukhari <em>Volume 3, Book 31, Number 166 )</em><br>
</p>
<p>Narrated Anas bin Malik: We used to travel with the Prophet and neither did 
  the fasting persons criticize those who were not fasting, nor did those who 
  were not fasting criticize the fasting ones. (Bukhari <em>Volume 3, Book 31, Number 
  168)</em><br>
</p>
<p>Narrated Tawus: Ibn 'Abbas said, &quot;Allah's Apostle set out from Medina 
  to Mecca and he fasted till he reached 'Usfan, where he asked for water and 
  raised his hand to let the people see him, and then broke the fast, and did 
  not fast after that till he reached Mecca, and that happened in Ramadan.&quot; 
  Ibn 'Abbas used to say, &quot;Allah's Apostle (sometimes) fasted and (sometimes) 
  did not fast during the journeys so whoever wished to fast could fast, and whoever 
  wished not to fast, could do so.&quot; (Bukhari <em>Volume 3, Book 31, Number 169)</em><br>
