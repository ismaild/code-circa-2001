
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &quot;If somebody eats or drinks forgetfully 
  then he should complete his fast, for what he has eaten or drunk, has been given 
  to him by Allah.&quot; Narrated 'Amir bin Rabi'a, &quot;I saw the Prophet cleaning 
  his teeth with Siwak while he was fasting so many times as I can't count.&quot; 
  And narrated Abu Huraira, &quot;The Prophet said, 'But for my fear that it would 
  be hard for my followers, I would have ordered them to clean their teeth with 
  Siwak on every performance of ablution.&quot; The same is narrated by Jabir 
  and Zaid bin Khalid from the Prophet who did not differentiate between a fasting 
  and a nonfasting person in this respect (using Siwak). Aisha said, &quot;The 
  Prophet said, &quot;It (i.e. Siwak) is a purification for the mouth and it is 
  a way of seeking Allah's pleasures.&quot; Ata' and Qatada said, &quot;There 
  is no harm in swallowing the resultant saliva.&quot; (Bukhari <em>Volume 3, Book 
  31, Number 154)</em></p>
