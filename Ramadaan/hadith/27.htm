
<p>Ziyad related to me from Malik that he had heard a man he trusted of the people 
  of knowledge say, &quot;The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant 
  him peace, was shown the life spans of the people (who had gone) before him, 
  or what Allah willed of that, and it was as if the lives of the people of his 
  community had become too short for them to be able to do as many good actions 
  as others before them had been able to do with their long lives, so Allah gave 
  him Laylat al-Qadr, which is better than a thousand months.&quot; (Malik Book 
  <em>19, Number 19.6.16)</em></p>
