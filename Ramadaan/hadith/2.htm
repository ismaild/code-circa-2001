
Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, &quot;Fasting is a shield (or a screen 
or a shelter). So, the person observing fasting should avoid sexual relation with 
his wife and should not behave foolishly and impudently, and if somebody fights 
with him or abuses him, he should tell him twice, 'I am fasting.&quot; The Prophet 
added, &quot;By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, the smell coming out from the mouth 
of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk. (Allah 
says about the fasting person), 'He has left his food, drink and desires for My 
sake. The fast is for Me. So I will reward (the fasting person) for it and the 
reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times.&quot; (Bukhari <em>Volume 3, Book 31, 
Number 118)</em>
