
<p>Narrated Sahl: The Prophet said, &quot;There is a gate in Paradise called Ar-Raiyan, 
  and those who observe fasts will enter through it on the Day of Resurrection 
  and none except them will enter through it. It will be said, 'Where are those 
  who used to observe fasts?' They will get up, and none except them will enter 
  through it. After their entry the gate will be closed and nobody will enter 
  through it.&quot; (Bukhari <em>Volume 3, Book 31, Number 120)</em><br>

<p>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, &quot;Whoever gives two kinds (of 
  things or property) in charity for Allah's Cause, will be called from the gates 
  of Paradise and will be addressed, 'O slaves of Allah! Here is prosperity.' 
  So, whoever was amongst the people who used to offer their prayers, will be 
  called from the gate of the prayer; and whoever was amongst the people who used 
  to participate in Jihad, will be called from the gate of Jihad; and whoever 
  was amongst those who used to observe fasts, will be called from the gate of 
  Ar-Raiyan; whoever was amongst those who used to give in charity, will be called 
  from the gate of charity.&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;Let my parents be sacrificed 
  for you, O Allah's Apostle! No distress or need will befall him who will be 
  called from those gates. Will there be any one who will be called from all these 
  gates?&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;Yes, and I hope you will be one of them.&quot;
