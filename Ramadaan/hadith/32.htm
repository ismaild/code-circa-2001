
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &quot;Whoever established prayers on 
  the night of Qadr out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then 
  all his previous sins will be forgiven; and whoever fasts in the month of Ramadan 
  out of sincere faith, and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous 
  sins will be forgiven.&quot; (Bukhari <em>Volume 3, Book 31, Number 125)</em></p>
