
<p>Yahya related to me from Malik from Nafi that Abdullah ibn Umar used to say, 
  &quot;Only some one who makes the intention to fast before dawn (actually) fasts.&quot; 
  Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab that A'isha and Hafsa, the wives 
  of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, also said that. (Malik 
  Book <em>18, Number 18.2.5)</em></p>
